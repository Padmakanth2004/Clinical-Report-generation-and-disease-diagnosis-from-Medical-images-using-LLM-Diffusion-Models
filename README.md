# Clinical Report Generation and Disease Diagnosis from Medical Images

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **automatic clinical report generation and disease diagnosis from medical images** using a combination of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Diffusion Models**. The entire workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook (code.ipynb)**, making it easy to understand, reproduce, and extend for research or academic purposes.

The system processes medical images, extracts meaningful visual features, performs disease prediction, and generates **human-readable clinical reports** using AI models.
